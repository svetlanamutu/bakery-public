    <p class="text-indentation">Would you have ever thought that a little girl, who at 8 years old, accidentally put a cup of salt in a batch of cookies, would ever want to bake cookies and other goodies for a living?
My name is Karen and I grew up on a small farm in southeastern Oklahoma. I was about 8 years old when my dear sweet Mom let me bake my first batch of cookies all by myself. For some reason, and I still do not know why to this day, I put a cup of sugar as well as a cup of salt in the cookies. When the first tray of cookies came out of the oven, my Daddy was sitting at the table waiting to eat the first one. When Daddy took his first bite, an unusual look came over his face. After he managed to swallow the first bite he said to me, “Missy, I think you got a little too much salt in there.” So, I got a cookie and took a bite and had to spit it out! I started crying and my Daddy sat me on his lap and told me it was okay and that I should try again. I didn’t want to, but Mom and Daddy wouldn’t let me give up. Mom and I went over the recipe and made a list of what I needed from the grocery store. Then Daddy drove all the way back to town to get just a few ingredients that I needed to start over. I never had a problem making those oatmeal cookies again. Thank you, Mom and Daddy!

    <p class="text-indentation">Fast forward to many years later and I reconnect on social media with a really nice guy from high school. Six months later we married and I moved to the great state of Texas! Shortly after moving, I am baking a batch of those oatmeal cookies from my childhood when my new husband, Robert, asked me to add some chocolate chunks to it. After eating about half a dozen right out of the oven he said that those were the best cookies he has ever put in his mouth and we should sell them. Because of those encouraging words, my childhood dream is coming true and 2Wrights’Delights has begun.
